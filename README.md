# Computational and Integrated Hydrology Group

Official group website repository.

This is built from Jekyll using the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) template. For more information on how to build the website, see my [blog post](https://hydroaggie.github.io/blog/2023/Create-Your-Personal-Website-Using-Github-Pages/).

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/LICENSE).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
